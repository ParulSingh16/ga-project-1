**_Description_**
"SNAKE GAME"

The Snake Game here has been build by using the following:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

Here, give a short description of the project. It can be a couple of sentences where you discuss the point in time during the course that you completed it, the topic of the project and potentially the tech stack.

**_About the Game_**

I have build a simple and basic" Snake Game" here, which has a functionality of creating a "game-board", a "Snake" and his "food" as the main features.

In this game everytime the snake eats the food the snake gets bigger.

**_Playing Instructions_**

To Start: press the "ENTER" key on the keyboard,
To move Left: press the "LEFT" ARROW" key on the keyboard,
To move Right: press the "RIGHT" ARROW" key on the keyboard,
To move Up: press the "UP ARROW" key on the keyboard,
To move Down: press the "DOWN" ARROW" key on the keyboard,

To Restart: "Refresh" the page

**_Rules of the game_**

If the snake touches the wall on either side of the game-board, the game will be automatically "OVER" and the snake will disappear.

**Timeframe, Brief & Working Team**

Instructions
This is the first individual project assigned by our Instructor to us.

This project was given as a Solo project but, the game rooms were created with the free access to be in touch to help eachother working on the same game and thus I have been in the same game group with my two other very helpful classmates Ms. Alice Lo and Mr. Joel Sahiti.
Also, we have been given the opportunity to seek help directly from our wonderful instructor- Mr. Tristan Hall and TA- Mr. Joe Freeman who have been really kind in helping us out solving the issues we have come across during this project.

**Timeframe**
We were given a week to complete this project.
We were also guided on how we can divide our timeframe
for eg: the project was assigned on Friday and we were suggested to get the MVP done by Monday evening or Tuesday morning and rest of the week we can then continue working on the CSS and Readme which actually helped us in understanding that a product that doesnt work is of no use if looks good. Thus, the most important task is to have a working game.

**Technologies Used**
Development Tools, Google, Google Fonts, youtube, VSCode, Git Hub repo.
